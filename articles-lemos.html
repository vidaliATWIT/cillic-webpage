		<h3>"Interview with Paul Lemos of Controlled Bleeding"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			This interview was originally conducted via email for an article written for Emerson College's Five Cent Sound Music Magazine. Thanks to Paul Lemos for his time and decades of music.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Q: From what I’ve read the first Controlled Bleeding record came out in the early 80’s. Was it your first project as a musician or did you have other bands before?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: My first band in Boston in the late 70's was called Controlled Bleeding , even though it had no relation at all to what I would do later. This was sort of a muti-media art project...When I moved back to New York, I simply kept the name, but began a new line up with my friend Gary Pecorino, playing organ...The music was kind of like a combination of the Ramones and Mahavishnu Orch...all instrumental and very intense at points...(This music was issued on CD awhile back..."BEFORE THE QUIET") We recorded a 7" single under the name Controlled Bleeding...That was around 1979. That group expanded and played at CBGB with bands like Suicide and our friends, Bloodless Pharaohs...When that group imploded, I took a long break from music...then embarked on experiments in sound that would evolve into the line up of Controlled Bleeding that recorded KNEES AND BONES. So, Controlled Bleeding has always been the band name I have used, even though a lot of the music might move in totally different directions.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Q: What was the approach to composition back then?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: The PRE KNEES and BONES group was playing highly structured, fast paced material, bringing together my love of music by bands like Red Era King Crimson with the simplicity and raw energy of some of the punk rock I was enjoying at the time...A few of the songs were really pretty good, and a lot of them were pretty shitty in retrospect...
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: When exactly did the first incarnation change for the second? Was the change in sound that happened alongside this on purpose? How did your working methods change both in composing and recording?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: After the first recorded line up split, I was pretty exhausted and fairly frustrated, since I had put a lot of sweat and blood into that group...So, the new work was just a means of pure venting...It had nothing to do with structure or music in any conventional sense...This was just a PURGE, pure aural violence.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The material on KNEES was mostly done live in a concrete studio with a big PA system that we blew to smithereens by the end of the sessions...It was just primal scream therapy put on tape...There was no composing whatsoever...Just bruising layers of feedback and as much distortion as possible...Most of of the tracks were recorded live to cassette at full blistering volume...a couple of pieces were developed on a 4 track recorder and developed through improvisation...We would record a lot of material then select the best sections and piece together the album.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: Related to this, what can you say about Joe Papa? How did he fit into Controlled Bleeding’s change in sound?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Joe Papa appeared when the old line up was trying to find an audience and figured that a singer would help...We did exactly one gig with Joey when the band simply collapsed...A couple of years later Joe came around again, but he did not really fit into the extreme noise work that I was doing...Soon, however, I would get back to doing more conventional things and that was the point whn Joey and I really worked well together. He was a great singer, and a really solid drummer but he only enjoyed very musical stuff, nothing ridiculously experimental...Over time, we were able to find common ground that allowed Controlled Bleeding to really blossom musically.It was very hard at first, but over time, I was able to move Joey to find his voice, and we would indulge in our mutual love of more progressive, bombastic music. At first it was very difficult, but as with any relationship...It took time to nurture and develop.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: How was it like being an experimental artist in the 80’s? Did you live on your own? What was your day-job like? How’d you find the backing to keep making the music you were making? How did that change as time went on?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I was always a high school teacher, as I still am today. This way, I never had to prostitute myself for a record company or follow trends to sell records. There was good money to be made in music when lps and cds were selling big numbers, but I never made my living from music. Generally, I recorded our work in my own studio, so costs were minimal. Certainly there are fewer labels that will invest money in projects...but I have been fortunate to work with some great people who are very committed to the music and not so much to profit making, so I have no complaints in the present.

		<p id="story">
			Q: What gear did you use? I’m particularly interested in the equipment used for Headcrack (personal favorite) and Body Samples I. What equipment did you keep as you move forward? What equipment did you add?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I never used a lot of gear at all. Most of Headcrack was made with guitar, bass, drums, found recordings, keyboards, processed sounds, and some electronics. It was all recorded on a 4 track reel to reel deck...very minimally done...Body Samples was much rawer...Some of it, the extreme noise tracks were done the same way KNEES was recorded, live to cassette in a basement...The more textured pieces were built from tape processing, guitars, sequencer, metals, various percussion, a lot of processed vocals and electronics...Later with Scourging Ground and Gilded Chambers, we moved to 8 track reel to reel, added samplers, more keyboards, better drums, and a lot of vocals, as well as found sound, metal percussion etc...
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: Somewhat related to Headcrack with it’s forays into sacred music, with the initial experimental phase I’ve understood that each record had a “purpose”, is this correct? Was there a larger idea for your discography or did each record have an individual goal? What was your intention for the listener?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: There was never really an intention for the listener, to be very honest. We always just made the albums for ourselves...sort of like a personal diary in sound...The different record certainly captured the emotional tone of life at the time, and I think the feelings they might evoke indicate what we were feeling, what we were going through when they were put to tape. Joe and I would deve deeply into sacred music on later records...I'm not sure why...There was just a need to create these recordings...It was a natural intuitive development, in finding Joe's voice and creating the sounds we imagined at the time...So, no, there is not deep concept to any of the records...They are simply documents of our emotional lives at the time...KNEES and BODY SAMPLES were made during a time of a lot of frustration and pent up rage, and I think you can hear that in the grooves of those albums...whereas Headcrack, Between Tides, Curd were developed in a much happier time when I was given free reign to experiment night and day...I was consumed by the recording process, and Joe and I were getting closer to what we wanted to achieve, better able to capture our vision, what we were hearing in our heads...and it just sort of progressed from  there until Joey died...
