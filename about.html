		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<p>I will occasionally receive emails asking about the site and what it's for. While I don't mind, I think it's fitting to provide some sort of clarification for the casual visitor.</p>
		<ul>
		<h3 id="question"><i>What's the Cillic Archive?</i></h3>
		<p id="answer">
			I first made this page to catalog all the things I was doing one particularly productive summer in 2020. Since then it's become the de-facto portfolio for my work and non-work. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="question"><i>What kinds of things do you post?</i></h3>
		<p id="answer">
			Whatever I'm working on in the worlds of music, software, writing, and occasionally video.
		</p>

		<h3 id="question"><i>Who owns this page?</i></h3>
		<p id="answer">
			Ian G. Vidal.
		</p>

		<h3 id="question"><i>How often does this page get updated?</i></h3>
		<p id="answer">
			Previously almost never, but I've made improvements in the site's infrastructure that should remedy that in the future.
		</p>

		<h3 id="question"><i>Is this a blog?</i></h3>
		<p id="answer">
			No. If any of the URLs for this page ever link to a Blogspot, Medium, or Substack, then I am certainly dead, and this page has been compromised by outside forces.
