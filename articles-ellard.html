		<h3>"Music Tech Series: Interview with Tom Ellard of Nilamox, formerly of Severed Heads"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			This interview is part of a series on the history of Music Technology. Tom Ellard is viciously forward thinking. He's written several articles on his website questioning, and occasionally poking fun at the dead-end revivalist trends in music tech. For this, as well as my great appreciation for his audio-visual work in Severed Heads and beyond, I emailed him some questions. I'm incredibly grateful he responded. Note: I lost the original questions I sent, so I've provided the general topic of his answers instead.

		<p id="story">
			Topic: On the importance or lack thereof of experimenting with sound in new, non-reiterative ways.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: 	The terms 'bleeding edge' and 'cutting edge' are useful. Trying completely new techniques is very difficult and there's little recognition as the issues are hard to explain/boring for others. Taking that exploration and wrapping it into a recipe will get recognition because the issues are simplified and popularised - as a 'solution'. We'd all like to be 'bleeding' but it hurts - it's much easier to retread old battles where the victory was determined long ago. So with electronic music the battles of the late 20th century are played over and over again, because the victory feels good. And painters still hang canvases in galleries.

		<p id="story">
			Topic: On replicating the workflow and/or sound of certain gear via creative limitations in the digital realm.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Now there are choices there's a retrospective myth that choices were always part of the culture. For example people can now prefer vinyl, but vinyl was once all you had. Cutting tape was all you had. And so on. It's a recent idea that restriction is virtue. It's probably helpful in guiding your practice when learning but something that should really come from self determination and not an arbitrary limit that was once imposed by an engineer. Music I made on 4 track tape is not automatically better than 16 track or DAW.

		<p id="story">
			Topic: On manipulating sounds, the greatness of sampling, and the reluctance of many synth nuts to interfere with their recorded work once a performance is captured.


		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: This is something I've tried to convey for a while - what is a 'note'? A note was the basic unit of an instrument for a long time - as you say, sampling broke that idea, one note can be a symphony - and now a 'note' can be remixing an entire work through spectral editing. (Actually that remix idea was at least as long back as Eno ripping apart the Pachelbel Canon in 1975.) There is always a paranoia about 'authenticity' in music - the synthesizer purists are particularly dreary about this.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Topic: On gear hunger, and the scavenging of synth demos to circumvent it.

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: There is such a thing as too many instruments. I had one or two keyboards for a very long time. More recently I had far too many and I didn't use them respectfully so I'm getting rid of them slowly. You just want to define the kinds of sounds you want to make and only then find the thing that makes the sound. There is almost no advantage in hardware. BTW the Nord Modular is not very interesting in practice, just use the free VCV rack instead. Take the sounds it makes and sample them.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Topic: On the importance of an instrument's phyisical interface vs its sound.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: 	I am not a very good musician but my friends who are classically trained are more keen on physical interface. But a single good controller keyboard saves an awful lot of fuss and it makes software just like hardware. For example I've got the Arturia suite and the dedicated controller for that. Works fine.
