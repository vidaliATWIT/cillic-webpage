		<h3>"Music Tech Series: Interview with Sound Designer Keith Hillebrandt"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			This interview is part of a series on the history of Music Technology. I reached out to Keith as I've been a huge fan of his work since I first heard Nine Inch Nail's the Fragile, later tracking down the sample discs he produced for Rarefaction. To me, his work represents the best of the quantum leap in creative music production that ocurred in the 90s, and his insight into his process is invaluable.

		<p id="story">
			Q: How did you start working on sample discs, what was that space like when you began? Was it a tight knit community of independent sound designers or something else?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I got involved with sound design libraries, after a few years of using TurboSynth, K2000 and the Emax samplers, when I met the guys at OSC while I was working at Opcode as a Studio Vision tester. I never thought of doing my own collection but Ron McLeod encouraged me and I went at it. The music/art scene in San Francisco was really vibrant then, right before the yuppies started buying up the South of Market and sanitizing all the edge off the city.

		<p id="story">
			Q: What was the main concept behind Useful Noise / Diffusion of Useful Noise etc. Did you attack your sample libraries like short pieces themselves, or did you try to get them to be somewhat neutral?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: The whole idea of the Useful Noise libraries was to give musicians alternative sounds for their music. Load them into your sampler and make it your own, make your music sound unique. At the time most commercial libraries were strictly techno, designed to make everyone sound the same. Guess the market really hasn’t changed much since then.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: I read that you started your proper foray into recording with an early Mac and MOTU's Performer. What did that first audio setup of yours look like in its totality?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Fat Mac running Performer and TurboSynth, Emu Emax and Emax II rack, a Roland JX-10, Juno 106 and a Jupiter 6 and a Tascam desk and 4 track cassette was my first studio setup, but I went through a load of other synths before that while playing in bands.

		</p>
		
		<p id="story">
			Q: Moving forward how did your workflow incorporate samplers and synthesizers? How did the evolution of sampling hardware (from early Akais to the Kurzweil K2000/2600) change your working methods if at all?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I had used samplers for years, Mirage, Akai, Emax but the introduction of the K2000 was revolutionary for me from a sound design standpoint. I had the extra added advantage to have been put on testing it’s editor/librarian for Opcode so I spent weeks digging deep into it. The VAST engine in it is still one of my favorite sound design tools. Years later I created several Reaktor patches mimicking the K2000 processing so I didn’t have to lug a keyboard on my travels. Have to find a way to get my old Kurzweil over here to Thailand one day.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: What did your setup look like when DAWs started hitting the market? Did you buy in early or was it a slow transition to hard disk recording? What DAW do you use nowadays?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Well since I was working at Opcode on Studio Vision I didn’t need to buy in early because I was in before it was out! The biggest thing that changed in my studio was a faster computer, SoundTools and I started buying used non-midi analog synths since I now had a high quality way to record them; ARP 2600, Roland SH-5 and Oberheim OB-1.

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I still use Logic X for most work and production projects, occasionally Ableton just to rearrange my thinking, but if I am creating sound or experimenting with ambience I’m using my Maschine MK3. I’ve got my whole Maschine system loaded up with 30 years of my sound design work so I can sit back and play it for hours, never touching the mouse.
