		<h3>"Mr. Perro"</h3>	
		<p id="story">
			The house was made of oil. A box under the bed with all the traces of an unhappy life. He had to be a writer, maybe a performance artist. No chance he was a dancer, the floors were too nice. The neighbors didn’t know him, but they wouldn’t have said much anyways. They all belonged to the same mute species. They might’ve been mentally handicapped. Anyways, it was open and shut.
		</p> 
		<p id="story">
			But that night I got to my room in the precinct with something on my mind. I sat on the bench thinking about the wounds they found on his hands. Two vertical bruises, as if he’d been carrying a metal placard in Hell. The image wasn’t completely foreign. He had something that seemed to defy death, or something beyond it.
		</p>	
		<p id="story">
			The next day they brought in reams of paper. Some of them had been found behind the sofa, others above the roof panels. There were even some in his pants. They were pictures of a made-up world, not too dissimilar to ours. The houses were chipboard, with wooden faces and cloudy plastic windows.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			In that world, the people were cut from magazines, barely silhouettes. When you looked down, you realized they didn’t have legs. And always waiting for something that was teetering on the edge of exploding. Up and about went the cut-out people, all in perfect synchrony. Going to work to complain about domestic life, then coming home to complain about work.

		</p> 
		<p id="story">
			That night I dreamt of a dog that barked in a room with no doors in the center of the house. Even though I couldn’t see it, I knew it was there. Slowly it deformed until it became two dogs, then three, etc. It was howling. At the peak of those 15 minutes when it realizes its completely alone. And then I saw it, and I woke up.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The room was freezing, my toes felt like they belonged to someone else. It was a hassle to get out from under the blanket to put my shoes on. But I had gotten a call earlier that morning.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The officer at the door would’ve recognized my face. So I went in through the western window. His room was just like the pictures, everything in its place. The tape was still over the door, over the desk. And sitting atop it was the letter with my name on it. I put it in my pocket, footsteps shuffling in the hall. I jumped into the closet, peeking through the gap between the doors. And there he was, just like I remembered him.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I burned the letter without reading it. It alleged a series of events that were incompatible with the reality of the case. I convinced the guard to turn up the thermostat in my room. Finally, I laid down on the bench with the blanket over me and dreamt I was a dog in a room with no doors. I waited an eternity before I remembered that face. In the end, I couldn’t help but howl.
