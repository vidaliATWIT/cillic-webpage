		<h3>"Music Tech Series: Interview with Chris Carter of Chris & Cosey, and Throbbing Gristle"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			This interview is part of a series on the history of Music Technology. If you know Throbbing Gristle, then you've heard of Chris Carter. Needless to say, Chris represents the pinnacle of the electronic music producer. A fearless tinkerer whose work opened up a whole world for what you could do with a few oscillators and some tape machines.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Q: What was the first setup you used to make music? (Either during your time as an audio engineer for broadcast, or before)
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: When I was about 12 years old my parents gave me a small portable Japanese reel to reel tape recorder for my birthday. I already had a couple of experimental electronics kits, that included enough basic components to build a transistor radio, blinking lamps and oscillators. The tape recorder came with a small microphone and I would record the noises from my electronics experiments onto tape and then do things like playing back the tape in reverse and adjusting the speed.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Performing these basic tape experiments triggered my interest into experimenting with sound and so I began nagging my father to let me use his hi-fi equipment - he was a music buff and had some really nice high-end hi-fi gear, including a fairly sophisticated B&O stereo reel to reel machine. Eventually, when I was about 13 or 14, he let me use his beloved hi-fi and I figured out how to hook up my little collection of audio bits and pieces with his gear and I started making some decent sounding recordings.

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			When I was about 16 or 17 I got an internship with a location TV sound recordist, a friend of the family. It was only for a year or so but I learned a lot during that period. Which primarily included operating a Nagra tape machine, so lots of loading and spooling tapes and connecting and handling boom mics etc.

		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: What drew you to use self-made instruments? Have you incorporated them moving forward in your work?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Those initial electronics kits I was given as a child really set my path in that direction. While I was still at school I started reading a monthly magazine called Practical Electronics. Each month they published various DIY circuits to build and which often included audio related projects. Every couple of months I would save enough of my pocket money to buy components for building those projects. Which in turn, over the years, developed into building actual electronic instruments of my own.

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I built my own instruments or modified off the shelf gear for many years, I still do occasionally.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: What was the recording process like for your studio work with TG, as well as for the Space Between EP you produced around that time? (I've seen pictures of a two tape-machine setup, but how were the machines routed? Were there ever any overdubs done? Dub mixes from multi-tracks?)


		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I would have a couple of tape machines containing previously recorded parts for playback lined up to play alongside my synths, drum machines and sequencers. The tape playback was sometimes additionally fed through effects (echoes, phasers etc.) and everything would be mixed down through a mixer (sometimes two mixers) onto a third tape machine. This is how I usually overdubbed previously recorded parts with live studio parts.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I've had quite a few reel to reel machines - Tandberg, Sony, Akai and TEAC plus I had access to a Revox A77 that I used quite often. But I also used stereo cassette recorders a lot alongside the reel to reel machines, usually synchronising two or three at a time by hand, much like they did at the Radiophonic Workshop back then, before affordable multitracks.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: Did you employ a traditional mixer and reel-to-reel configuration? (As in did you mix down from a multi-track into a master 2 track? Or was it all just live through a mixer direct to 2 track?)
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: In the early days - around 1976/1977 - everything was recorded directly through a mixer (or two) to 2 track tape. Either to a stereo reel to reel machine or onto a stereo cassette deck, sometimes to both. By 1978 we could afford to rent a multitrack, initially 4 track, then 8 track and eventually we recorded onto 16 track.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: How did you go about synchronising tapes, drum machines and the Roland modular in those days?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Well the drum machines, sequencers and synths were mostly synced via gates, triggers or later using Sync24.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			By the time I got my Roland 100M I had already been developing a technique of recording my rhythmic audio mixes onto one channel of stereo tape and synchronised pulse signals onto the second channel of tape. I'd built a small pulse detector that could output a trigger into the step input of my sequencers so that I could play back the tape and run new sequences in time with what I had recorded earlier. It wasn’t always entirely accurate but when I got the System 100M I used the 172 module Gate Delay feature as a trigger detector, which was more dependable. Of course the previously recorded parts were always in mono but they could be processed into a stereo image using effects when doing the final mix down to tape.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: What components did you use to build the Mellotron-like proto-sampler used in the group? (I've read online that it was a keyboard controlling a few Sony Walkmans, but how exactly?)
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: There were three of those units. I first built a prototype 'mellotron like’ multi-tape keyboard player in 1978 using three auto-reverse cassette machines, the type usually fitted into a car dashboard. I’d modified the players so that all of the four tracks from each tape head were available simultaneously. The 12 tracks were routed to a one octave music keyboard and individual tracks could be played by pressing down on a key. The machines  were playing answer machine endless loop cassettes - which came in various lengths. But the unit was heavy and bulky and difficult to maintain. Then 1979 Sleazy returned from a working trip to New York with a bag full of these new stereo cassette players called Sony Walkmans. So I built a new compact multi-tape player using a smaller 7-note keyboard and included a basic step sequencer that could also trigger the channels automatically if needed. This version still exists and is now in our archive - it was Sleazy’s main ‘sampler' until he got an Apple II computer. There was also a third version (based on the second version) but with a larger keyboard and more featured sequencer.

			Q: What was the process like for recording more song-based dance tracks under Chris & Cosey, particularly in the early to mid-80s? (Would you lay down live synth/drum machine tracks first and then add guitars/vocals/cornet? Would it all be live? Or would the two of you write songs first and then try to record them proper?)
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: By the mid-80s we had moved out of our small London house with its tiny studio into a much larger property (previously a school) and expanded our studio in the process, and we had our own 16 track by then too. But as always the majority of our songs are constructed and written initially by me and/or Cosey improvising around a drum pattern or sample loop. Often with Cosey playing a melody or singing lyrics and me changing a pattern, bass line or loops at the same time. We’d then record a basic outline of the song to the multitrack (which had a pre-recorded SMPTE code on) and take it from there. Adding more vocals, keyboards, sequences, guitars or cornet as the song process progressed. Sometimes we’d wipe channels or re-record them, sometimes bounce tracks onto other tracks. Every song was different.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Sometimes I’d work on a bunch of drum patterns and sequences with a notion of which song it might be for but Cosey would want to go in a different direction with them - so often something meant for one song would be repurposed for another completely different song - but usually drums, bass or sequences. That didn’t happen so much with actual recorded elements such as vocals, cornet or guitar. Sometimes a song would come about purely from a vocal phrase Cosey had, or a guitar part or cornet refrain.

			Q: How did the introduction midi, digital sampling and computer-based sequencing affect your studio work if at all? How did you incorporate these to your existing workflow?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: Our move to MIDI happened relatively slowly, mostly due to our finances. We didn’t have anything MIDI in our London studio and because MIDI was introduced just as we were moving out of London and setting up our new house and studio we didn’t have much spare cash left to invest in new MIDI gear. Most of our gear was still based on Sync24, or trigger in/out.

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I think our first MIDI keyboard was a Casio CZ101 and our first MIDI drum machine was Roland TR707, in 1985. But it wasn’t until the late 1980s that we started really getting into MIDI by buying an Akai S900 sampler, a Roland D50 keyboard, a Roland MC500 sequencer and some MIDI effects units… all in the same year. Then everything changed considerably, for the better - the golden years you might say. Not only did we have all this cool sounding MIDI gear but we could also synchronise the whole setup to 16 track tape really easily - which basically doubled our track count. I wouldn’t say it changed our workflow then an awful lot because we’d always had this basic 'gear synchronised to tape’ setup going on for years anyway, but it was just reliable, dependable and a lot more flexible.
		</p>

		<p id="story">
			Q: Moving towards the 00/10s did your approach change as audio recording became possible on computers? What did your studio setup look like then? How has it changed since then?

		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I think the biggest change to our workflow came in the early 90s when we expanded our rack of Akai samplers and changed our MIDI computers from Atari 1040STs to Apple Macs running Emagic software. We maxed out our samplers memories and hard drives and we developed a technique of recording directly into them like a multitrack, and by using triggers from the computer to effectively cut and paste clips of audio into a MIDI timeline. We could then bounce the results from the samplers onto our 16 track machine. This was all pre DAW audio techniques and it was pretty basic by todays standards but served us well for a few years. Although having said that we did lose a complete recording session once when one of our removable hard drives fatally crashed taking all our work with it in the process... never to be recovered.

			Q: As someone who's lived through several generations of new equipment and tech, including the transition from hardware to software, do you think that one's tools has any effect on the process of composing and recording, and the way one feels when doing it?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A: I think that, particularly in our genres of music, equipment absolutely has an effect on one's process of composing and recording. Almost any genre of music composed on a piano, a guitar, a cornet, or even a flute will primarily comprise the same fundamentals of melody, rhythm, tone and expression. Of course if played well there is nothing wrong with that. But even if you played an experimental piece with any of those instruments they would still impart to the listener those same basic elements of sound, it's physics. However, record any of those sounds and put them into a software audio editor, a sampler or even just onto tape and you can change them beyond recognition. Which in turn and in itself could inspire a completely new composition. Of course when you start combining those various techniques with each other there are essentially no limits and you enter the heady realms of undiscovered indescribable sounds.
